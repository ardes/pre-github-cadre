# This cookie-based session store is the Rails default. Sessions typically
# contain at most a user_id and flash message; both fit within the 4K cookie
# size limit. Cookie-based sessions are dramatically faster than the
# alternatives.
#
# A secure hash is included with the cookie to ensure data integrity:
# a user cannot alter his user_id without knowing the secret key included in
# the hash. New apps are generated with a session :secret option in
# Application Controller. Set your own for old apps you're upgrading.
# Note that changing the secret invalidates all existing sessions!
#
# If you have more than 4K of session data or don't want your data to be
# visible to the user, pick another session store.
#
# CookieOverflow is raised if you attempt to store more than 4K of data.
# TamperedWithCookie is raised if the data integrity check fails.
